    <h3>How to Make Churros</h3>
    <p>Churros (Mexican fritters) are very common at fairs. In my border hometown, the line at this stand is always overwhelming. People wait hours in line just to get a taste of these churros. I have run across several recipes but this is the best one by far.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a small saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil and remove from the heat. Stir in flour, stirring until mixture forms a ball. </li>
        <li>Heat oil for frying in a deep fryer or deep pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a sturdy pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. Carefully pipe a few 5- to 6-inch strips of dough into the hot oil; work in batches so you don't crowd the fryer. Cook until golden; use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer churros to paper towels to drain. </li>
        <li>Combine 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Roll drained churros in cinnamon and sugar mixture. </li>
    </ol>
